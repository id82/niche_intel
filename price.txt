Of course. Here is a robust and logical strategy for extracting the book price of $39.00 from the provided HTML.

This strategy is designed to be resilient to minor changes in the page's HTML by prioritizing the most specific and semantically important price elements while providing logical fallbacks.

### Guiding Principles

1.  **Scope Limitation:** All searches will be confined within the main buy box container, `<div id="Northstar-Buybox">`, to prevent accidentally extracting prices from other page sections (like "Frequently bought together" or ads).
2.  **Prioritization:** The strategy prioritizes the most prominent "buy box" price, as this is the final price used for the "Add to Cart" action. The price listed next to the format type (e.g., "Paperback") serves as a strong secondary option.
3.  **Data Cleaning:** The final step in any successful extraction is to clean the raw text (e.g., " `$39.00` ") into a usable numerical format (e.g., `39.00`).

### The Multi-Tiered Extraction Strategy

This strategy proceeds in order. The first successful extraction is used.

#### Tier 1: Primary Target - The Main Buy Box Price

This is the most reliable source, as it's the price directly associated with the purchase action. The HTML provides two excellent ways to get this.

**Method A (Preferred): Reconstructing the Price from Components**
This method targets the specific `<span>` elements that make up the price, which is often more stable than a single text block.

*   **Logic:** Find the container for the main price and combine the symbol, whole number, and fractional parts.
*   **Selectors:**
    1.  **Whole Part:** `#corePriceDisplay_desktop_feature_div .a-price-whole`
        *   *Result:* `39.`
    2.  **Fractional Part:** `#corePriceDisplay_desktop_feature_div .a-price-fraction`
        *   *Result:* `00`
*   **Action:** Concatenate the text from these two selectors (`"39." + "00"`) to get `"39.00"`.

**Method B (Alternative): Using the Screen-Reader Text**
This method is simpler as it grabs the complete price string from a `<span>` designed for screen readers.

*   **Logic:** Target the `<span>` with the `aok-offscreen` class that contains the full price text.
*   **Selector:** `#corePriceDisplay_desktop_feature_div > .a-section > .aok-offscreen`
    *   *Result:* `   $39.00  `
*   **Action:** Extract the text content. This will require cleaning to remove whitespace and the currency symbol.

***If Tier 1 fails, proceed to Tier 2.***

#### Tier 2: Secondary Target - The Selected Format Price

This is the price shown next to the selected book format (Paperback). It's a reliable fallback if the main price block structure changes.

*   **Logic:** Find the list item for the currently `selected` book format and extract the price from its designated `<span>`.
*   **Selector:** `.swatchElement.selected .slot-price .a-color-price`
    *   *Result:* ` $39.00 `
*   **Action:** Extract the text content and clean it. The use of `.selected` ensures you don't accidentally get the price for an unselected format like "Hardcover" if it were also present.

***If Tier 2 fails, proceed to Tier 3.***

#### Tier 3: General Fallback

This is a "last resort" search that looks for any element with a common price-related class within the buy box. It is less precise but can succeed where others fail.

*   **Logic:** Perform a broader search for a `<span>` with a class like `a-color-price`.
*   **Selector:** `#Northstar-Buybox .a-color-price`
*   **Action:** This selector returns two elements in the provided HTML. The strategy should be to take the **first** element found, as it corresponds to the format price, which is a reasonable default.

### Step 4: Data Normalization (Crucial)

Regardless of which tier succeeds, the raw text must be cleaned and converted to a number.

**Input examples:** `  $39.00 `, `"39."` + `"00"`, ` $39.00 `

1.  **Remove Whitespace:** Trim all leading and trailing whitespace.
    *   `"$39.00"`
2.  **Remove Non-Numeric Characters:** Remove currency symbols (`$`), commas, and any other text that isn't a digit or a decimal point.
    *   `"39.00"`
3.  **Convert to Number:** Convert the cleaned string into a float or decimal data type.
    *   `39.00` (as a number)

This robust, multi-tiered approach ensures the highest probability of successfully extracting the correct price, even if the website's layout is slightly modified.
