Here is a comprehensive analysis of the Chrome extension and a strategic plan to speed up the scraping process using `chrome.declarativeNetRequest`.

### Analysis of the Current Scraping Process

First, let's break down the current architecture and identify the performance bottleneck.

1.  **Orchestration:** The process is managed by `background.js`. It receives a `start-analysis` command from `popup.js`.
2.  **Initial Scrape:** It performs an initial SERP (Search Engine Results Page) analysis on the user's active tab to get a list of ASINs. This step is fast as it only involves one tab.
3.  **The Bottleneck (Concurrent Tab Creation):** The core of the deep-dive analysis happens in `processAsinQueue`. This function iterates through a list of ASINs and, for each one, `processSingleAsin` is called.
    *   `processSingleAsin` creates a new, inactive background tab (`chrome.tabs.create`).
    *   It waits for the tab's `load` event to complete. **This is the main slowdown.** A full Amazon product page is resource-heavy, loading high-resolution images, fonts, numerous stylesheets, media for videos, and third-party tracking/ad scripts.
    *   Once loaded, it injects `scrapers.js` to extract data.
    *   Finally, it closes the tab (`chrome.tabs.remove`).
4.  **Data Extraction (`scrapers.js`):** The crucial part is understanding what `runFullProductPageExtraction` actually needs from the page to avoid blocking essential resources.
    *   **Text & Attributes:** BSR, publisher, publication date, dimensions, page count, author name, review text, etc., are all extracted from HTML text content or element attributes. This does **not** require images, CSS, fonts, or media to be loaded.
    *   **Image URLs:** The scraper extracts the `src` attribute from `<img>` tags (e.g., `cover_url`, `author_info.imageUrl`, A+ content images). It only needs the URL string, not the actual downloaded image bytes. Blocking the image requests is perfectly fine.
    *   **Video Info:** The UGC video scraper (`extractUgcVideos`) extracts metadata from `data-` attributes on `div` elements. It does **not** need the video player or the video file itself to load.
    *   **Counts:** A+ module count, review image count, and video count are derived from counting DOM elements. This is unaffected by blocking resources.
    *   **Dependencies:** The scraper relies entirely on the **HTML DOM structure** and the `data-` attributes present in it. It does not depend on the visual rendering of the page.

**Conclusion:** The current process is slowed down by waiting for non-essential resources to load in each of the dozen-plus tabs it creates. The data extraction logic is compatible with an aggressive resource-blocking strategy.

### Plan to Accelerate Tab Lifecycle with `declarativeNetRequest`

The goal is to make the background tabs load a "skeleton" version of the page, containing just the necessary HTML structure, which will drastically reduce the `load` time.

#### Step 1: Activate the Existing Resource Blocking Code

The `background.js` file already contains placeholder functions `enableResourceBlocking` and `disableResourceBlocking`, but the calls to them are disabled. The first step is to activate them in the correct places.

**In `background.js`:**

1.  **In the `start-analysis` listener:** Enable blocking right after confirming the analysis will start.
2.  **In the `stop-analysis` listener:** Disable blocking to return the browser to its normal state.
3.  **In `processAsinQueue`:** Disable blocking upon successful completion or when the process is stopped.

This ensures that resource blocking is only active during the analysis and is cleaned up afterward.

#### Step 2: Refine the `declarativeNetRequest` Rule

The current rule in `background.js` is a good starting point, but we can make it more robust and effective. The goal is to block as much as possible without breaking the site's basic functionality for the scraper.

I will define two rules:
1.  **Rule #1: Block Heavy Resource Types.** This is the main workhorse. It will block images, media, fonts, and stylesheets, which account for the majority of page load time and data.
2.  **Rule #2: Block Known Third-Party Scripts.** This will block common analytics, tracking, and advertising scripts that are not needed and can add significant load time.

**Proposed Rules:**

```javascript
// Rule to block common heavy resource types
const RESOURCE_BLOCKING_RULE = {
    id: 1,
    priority: 1,
    action: { type: "block" },
    condition: {
        // Apply this rule to all URLs...
        "urlFilter": "*", 
        // ...but only for these resource types
        "resourceTypes": [
            "image",       // All images (product, ads, UI)
            "media",       // Video and audio files
            "font",        // Web fonts
            "stylesheet"   // All CSS files
        ]
    }
};

// Rule to block common tracking and advertising domains
const SCRIPT_BLOCKING_RULE = {
    id: 2,
    priority: 1,
    action: { type: "block" },
    condition: {
        // Block requests to these specific domains
        "requestDomains": [
            "doubleclick.net",
            "google-analytics.com",
            "googletagmanager.com",
            "scorecardresearch.com",
            "amazon-adsystem.com",
            "mads.amazon-adsystem.com",
            "advertising.amazon.com",
            "aan.amazon.com"
        ],
        // Only block scripts and sub-documents from them
        "resourceTypes": ["script", "sub_frame"]
    }
};
```

This two-rule approach is clean and effective. Rule #1 provides the biggest speed boost. Rule #2 adds an extra layer of optimization by cutting out unnecessary JavaScript execution.

#### Step 3: Implement Code Changes

Here are the specific code modifications required in `background.js`.

**File: `background.js`**

```javascript
// background.js

// ... (keep existing variables)

// Tab monitoring for better resource management
let monitoredTabs = new Set();
let analysisInProgress = false;
let shouldStopAnalysis = false;

// Initialize background script
console.log("background.js: Service worker started/restarted");

// ... (keep keep-alive listeners)

// --- START: MODIFIED RESOURCE BLOCKING SECTION ---
const RESOURCE_BLOCKING_RULE_ID = 1;
const SCRIPT_BLOCKING_RULE_ID = 2;

async function enableResourceBlocking() {
    try {
        if (!chrome.declarativeNetRequest) {
            console.warn("background.js: declarativeNetRequest API not available.");
            return;
        }
        
        const RESOURCE_BLOCKING_RULE = {
            id: RESOURCE_BLOCKING_RULE_ID,
            priority: 1,
            action: { type: "block" },
            condition: {
                "urlFilter": "*", 
                "resourceTypes": ["image", "media", "font", "stylesheet"]
            }
        };

        const SCRIPT_BLOCKING_RULE = {
            id: SCRIPT_BLOCKING_RULE_ID,
            priority: 1,
            action: { type: "block" },
            condition: {
                "requestDomains": [

                    "scorecardresearch.com", "amazon-adsystem.com", "mads.amazon-adsystem.com",
                    "advertising.amazon.com", "aan.amazon.com"
                ],
                "resourceTypes": ["script", "sub_frame"]
            }
        };

        await chrome.declarativeNetRequest.updateDynamicRules({
            removeRuleIds: [RESOURCE_BLOCKING_RULE_ID, SCRIPT_BLOCKING_RULE_ID], // Clear old rules first
            addRules: [RESOURCE_BLOCKING_RULE, SCRIPT_BLOCKING_RULE]
        });
        
        console.log("background.js: Resource and script blocking rules enabled successfully.");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("background.js: Failed to enable resource blocking:", error);
    }
}

async function disableResourceBlocking() {
    try {
        if (!chrome.declarativeNetRequest) {
            console.warn("background.js: declarativeNetRequest API not available.");
            return;
        }

                sendResponse({ success: false, message: error.message || "Unknown error occurred" });
            }

    } else if (request.command === "stop-analysis") {

        (async () => {
            await disableResourceBlocking();
            
            const tabsToClose = Array.from(monitoredTabs);
            tabsToClose.forEach(async (tabId) => {
                try {

    chrome.storage.local.remove(['serpData', 'asinsToProcess', 'currentDomain', 'searchKeyword']);
}

// ... (no other changes needed in the file)
```

#### Step 4: Verification and Testing

1.  **Load the Unpacked Extension:** Update the code as described above and reload the extension in `chrome://extensions`.
2.  **Inspect Background Tabs:** When you start an analysis, quickly go to the Chrome Task Manager (`Shift+Esc` or More Tools -> Task Manager) to see the background tabs being created. Their memory and CPU footprint should be significantly lower.
3.  **Use DevTools Network Panel:**
    *   Find one of the background scraping tabs in the `chrome://extensions` "Inspect views" list (they will appear and disappear quickly).
    *   Open its DevTools and go to the **Network** tab.
    *   You should see a large number of requests for images, CSS, and fonts with a "Blocked" status, confirming the rules are working.
4.  **Measure Performance:** The most direct measure of success will be the total time taken to complete the analysis for 10 products. This should be noticeably faster. The `console.log` timestamps in `background.js` will help benchmark the time taken for each batch.

This plan directly addresses the performance bottleneck by implementing a robust and safe resource-blocking strategy tailored to the specific data being scraped, resulting in a significantly faster and more efficient extension.
