the csv export writes the price column entries as $31.00$25.12(-19%) in some cases. output 2 columns instead printing the List Price and Discount Price. Discount Price can be empty if there's no discount. The currencies include the dollar sign in the values inside of the CSV, which forces them to be formatted as text, whereas they should be numbers so do not include the currency symbol. The same goes for the two price columns. The CSV contains the select column as well, which is blank and thus not needed. the type column can be omitted as well.
